# Hi, I'm Dania Hamimi 👋
In the world full of people saying "Curiosity kills the cat" I am not afraid to be curious. I love experimenting with new technologies, and exploring the edges of what’s possible. Whether it’s building something from scratch, diving into a new programming language, I thrive on challenges that push me to learn, adapt, and create. 

  Beyond coding, I bring a mix of creative and technical skills to the table. While hands-on projects and leadership roles have strengthened my teamwork, problem-solving, and project management abilities. I enjoy taking initiative and leading projects from concept to completion, always keeping creativity, efficiency, and impact at the core.
